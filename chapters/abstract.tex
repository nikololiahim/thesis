    This thesis describes a proof-of-concept implementation of static analyzers for object-oriented programs that detect two defects of the "fragile base class" family - unanticipated mutual recursion and unjustified assumption in modifier (subclass). The implementation of the analyzers relies on an intermediate representation called EO (short for Elegant Objects), which is based on $\varphi$-calculus - a formalization of common object-oriented semantics inspired by the decorator pattern. The correctness of the analyzers was verified using the property-based testing approach, as well as hand-written unit tests to catch the important edge cases.
